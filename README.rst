Set of reflection libraries built on top of the C++ reflection facility
proposed in `P0194`_ (Static reflection) and `P0385`_.

For the moment the primary purpose of this library is to show, that
the reflection API proposed for standardisation in P0194 is powerfull
enough to be used as the foundation for other higher-level reflection
APIs using various programming paradigms.

[section:operator operator [^MIRRORED]]
[/====================================]

[header reflection]

The [link mirror.intro.metaobjects metaobjects] reflecting various program
declarations and other base-level entities can be obtained 
by invoking the [^MIRRORED] operator.

The result of the [^MIRRORED] operator is an instantiation of
the [^__metaobject] template.

The [^MIRRORED] operator takes the same arguments as the [^reflexpr] operator.

For example:

[import operator.cpp]
[mirrored_operator_example_1]

[endsect]
